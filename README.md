The purpose of this code is to automate the first trivial filtering steps in the processing of the applications for the TReND in Africa Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning Basics course.

This code is organized as a set of functions to be applied as a processing pipeline on the application responses data (See [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4pMEOgMuenuFpN6zXQtZlpYFXwPat2P4-SzZaN8mFg/edit?usp=drivesdk)).

### **How to use (as a developer):**
Just clone the Github repository and get into the business!\
If you have anaconda and yupyter installed locally you can just clone the repory directly on your machine. Elsewise, you can clone it into Google Colab.
(In either case, if you have any valuable contributions, don't hesitatte to do a Pull Request).

### **How to use (as a reviewer):**
Clone the whole repo locally, or in Google Colab, so you can run the Noetbook cells. In case of running it in Colab, don't forget to save and download the resulting Excel sheet of the processed responses into a local folder.
